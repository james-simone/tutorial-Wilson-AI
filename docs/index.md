## What is the Wilson cluster?

The [Wilson cluster](https://computing.fnal.gov/wilsoncluster/) (WC) is a High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster
available to the entire Fermilab scientific and engineering community. The WC is designed for running and being able
to efficiently scale up parallel workloads over many CPUs and/or GPUs.
The Wilson cluster provides
HPC services typical of larger HPC centers such as NERSC, OLCF, or ALCF. The WC is considered a medium-scale HPC facility which
can provide a development on ramp to the big HPC centers. Features include
- up to O(800) CPU cores per job for tighly-coupled parallel computations (MPI, [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/), ...)
- access to A100, V100, and P100 [NVIDIA GPUs](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/) ([CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit), NVIDIA [HPC sdk](https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-sdk))
- multi-GPU equipped worker nodes and the ability to scale jobs to multiple GPUs
- ability to run containerized applications [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/)
- high-bandwith, low-latency [InfiniBand](https://community.fs.com/blog/infiniband-vs-ethernet-which-is-right-for-your-data-center-network.html) networking among workers and storage
- high-performace [Lustre](https://doc.lustre.org/lustre_manual.xhtml#understandinglustre.tab1) parallel filesystem for large data sets
- communal `/work1` file areas shared by project members 
- [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/SLUG18/slurm_overview.pdf) batch system designed to run HPC workloads
- [Globus](https://www.globus.org/data-transfer) (endpoint: `fnal#wilson`) for transfers among data centers

Convergence: HPC features are important for AI performace!

### I'm just learning AI and I prefer Jupyter notebooks to do tuorials and GPU code development

Fermilab offers the Elastic Analysis Facility [EAF](https://analytics-hub.fnal.gov/hub/login?next=%2Fhub%2F)
where the main user experience is based around
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) nodebooks. 

## Accessing the Wilson cluster


## The Slurm batch system

Slurm is a common batch system on HPC clusters. It is open source, highly scalable, and 
it can schehedule parallel jobs taking advantage of the cluster topology for best performance.

The commonly used slurm commands include
| command                                          | description |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|
|[squeue](https://slurm.schedmd.com/squeue.html)   | reports the state of jobs |
|[sbatch](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html)   | submit a job script for later execution |
|[scancel](https://slurm.schedmd.com/scancel.html) | cancel a pending or running job |
|[salloc](https://slurm.schedmd.com/salloc.html)   | allocate resources and spawn a shell which is then used to execute srun commands |
|[srun](https://slurm.schedmd.com/srun.html)       | submit a job for execution or initiate job steps in real time |

See the [downloadable](https://slurm.schedmd.com/pdfs/summary.pdf) PDF cheatsheet for a summary of the commands. SchedMD has a
[quick start guide](https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html) for slurm users.
See [slurm](https://computing.fnal.gov/wilsoncluster/slurm-job-scheduler/) for the WC slurm configuration and
[job dispatch](https://computing.fnal.gov/wilsoncluster/job-dispatch-explained/) to understand how jobs are pioritized and run.

### Details about your accounts

You can find the name of your default account with the command
```
sacctmgr list user name=$USER
```
```
      User   Def Acct     Admin
---------- ---------- ---------
    simone    wc_test      None
```
My default slurm account is called `wc_test`.

Many users are members of multiple accounts with different quality of service (QOS) levels.
```
sacctmgr list user WithAssoc Format=User,Account,QOS,DefaultQOS name=$USER
```
```
      User    Account                  QOS   Def QOS
---------- ---------- -------------------- ---------
    simone   scd_devs     opp,regular,test       opp
    simone lqcd_bench     opp,regular,test       opp
    simone  spack4hpc     opp,regular,test       opp
    simone   deep_lgt     opp,regular,test       opp
    simone      axial     opp,regular,test       opp
    simone    wc_test     opp,regular,test       opp
```
The QOS level determines the limitations on jobs
| QOS  | description | priority | max wall | other |
|------|-------------|---------:|---------:|:------|
| opp  | opportunistic |  0     | 8:00:00  | maxSubmit=50 |
| regular | Normal QoS (default) | 25 | 24:00:00  |   |
| test    | quick tests  | 75 | 4:00:00 | maxRun=1; maxSubmit=3 |
| admin   | admin testing | 100 |  |  |

### Slurm partitions

A partition in slurm is a way to categorize worker nodes by their unique features. On the Wilson cluster we distinguish workers meant for CPU computing from GPU-acclerated workers. There is a separate partition for the one IBM Power9 "Summit-like" worker since the Power9 architechture is not
binary compatible with the common AMD/Intel x86_64 architecture. There is also a test partition to set aside CPU workers for rapid testing.
Slurm allows setting job limits by partition.
| partition   | description  | avail Nodes | max Nodes  |  max Wall  |  default wall  | exclusive use |
|-------------|--------------|------------:|-----------:|-----------:|---------------:|:-------------:|
| cpu_gce     | CPU workers (16-core) | 90 | 50 | 24:00:00  |  8:00:00  |  Y |
| cpu_gce_test | CPU workers (16-core) | 10 | 5 | 4:00:00  | 1:00:00 | Y |
| gpu_gce      | various GPU workers | 11 | depends on GPU | 24:00:00 | 8:00:00 | N |
| gpu_gce_ppc | IBM Power9 4x V100 | 1 | 1 | 24:00:00 | 8:00:00 | N |

### How to specify the number and type of GPU in a batch job

All GPU worker nodes are in the `gpu_gce` partition except the IBM Power9 worker which in the `gpu_gce_ppc` partition.
The WC has a variery of GPU worker nodes with different generations of NVIDIA GPUs. The "Slurm spec." in the table below is how
how you tell slurm the GPU type you want. If you do not specifiy a type, you job will run with first available GPU of
any type. 


| Nodes | GPU type | CUDA cores | device mem. [GB] | Slurm spec. | GPUs/Node | Cores/GPU  |  Mem/GPU [GB] |
|------:|:---------|-----------:|-----------------:|:------------|----------:|------------:|---------------:|
|  1    | [A100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/) | 6912       |  80              | a100        |  4        |   16        |  126          |
|  4    | [V100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/v100/) | 5120       |  32              | v100        |  2        |   20        |   92          |
|  1    | [P100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-p100/) | 3584       |  16              | p100        |  8        |   2        |   94          |
|  1    | [P100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-p100/) | 3584       |  16              | p100nvlink  |  2        |   14        |  500          |
|  1 IBM   | [V100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/v100/) | 5120       |  32             |v100nvlinkppc64 | 4     |   8(32t)  |  250          |

A GPU job can request more than one GPU to enable parallel use GPUs by your code.
Slurm, however, will not permit mixing different slurm specifications within a job, e.g., a slurm job cannot request
eight V100 plus eight P100 devices. GPU workers are generally shared by by jobs requesting fewer than the maximum number of GPUs in a node.
GPUs a never shared among different jobs, each job has exclusive use of the GPUs slurm assigns to it.

Slurm manages GPUs as generic resource via the `--gres` flag to the commands `sbatch`, `salloc`, or `srun`. For example,
| slurm                |  description           |
|:--------------------|:-----------------------|
| `--gres=gpu:1`      | one GPU of any type per node   |
| `--gres=gpu:p100:1` | one P100 GPU per node          |
| `--gres=gpu:v100:2` | two V100 GPUs per node -- the max on the Intel V100 workers |
| `--gres=gpu:v100:2 --nodes=2` | four V100 GPUs total on two worker nodes |

The GPU workers, by default, are shared by batch jobs. The batch system is configured to portion out CPU and RAM to each batch job. GPU jobs are assigned default values `--cpu-cores-per-gpu=2` and `--mem-per-gpu=30G`. Jobs may request more than the default values. The table above shows suggested maximum `Cores/GPU` and `Mem/GPU` values assuming resources are divided evenly among GPUs.

### Caveat concerning job submission

**Please note that slurm jobs will NOT run from your home directory on the Wilson cluster!**

Your Wilson home directory is your lab-wide  "nashome" directory. The `/nashome` filesystem is mounted with Kerberos authentication, and
unfortunately, Kerberos is not currently compatible with slurm.
Start batch jobs from your area under either `/work1` or `/wclustre`.

### Interactive job

Interactive batch jobs are started using the `srun` command. For example, with the default slurm account and QOS, the command below
requests a single P100 GPU for one hour of wall time
```
srun --unbuffered --pty --partition=gpu_gce --gres=gpu:p100:1 --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 --cpus-per-task=2 --time=00:10:00 /bin/bash
```
The request specifies one CPU task per node, each task is allocated four CPU cores to allow threads to execution on distinct cores.

This batch job will potentially sharing a worker with other jobs since the default is non-exclusive scheduling for GPU workers, and
the request does not ask for all available node resources.
Once a suitable node is avialable, a bash shell will start on the worker. You can then type interactive commands that run on the
GPU worker. For example, the command [nvidia-smi](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-system-management-interface)
will show this job is assigned one GPU
```

### Batch scripts

Workflow commands to be executed in batch mode are put into a batch script. The variables prefaced with `#SBATCH`
are [job submission options](https://slurm.schedmd.com/pdfs/summary.pdf) transmitted to slurm. Below, is a simple batch script. 
The batch script is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/james-simone/tutorial-Wilson-AI/main/examples/simple_batch/simple_batch.sh).
```
#! /bin/bash

#SBATCH --job-name=simple
#SBATCH --mail-type=NONE
#SBATCH --output=job_%x_%A.out
#SBATCH --partition=gpu_gce
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:p100:1
#SBATCH --tasks-per-node=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=2
#SBATCH --time=00:05:00

## Why containers are recommended for AI


### Configuring Apptainer

Apptainer is provided as a software module. We can check what versions of Apptainer are available.
```
module avail apptainer
```
```
------------------------------------------------ /srv/software/hpc/modulefiles -------------------------------------------------
   apptainer/1.1.0    apptainer/1.1.3 (D)
```
The 1.1.3 version will be loaded by default.
```
module load apptainer
```
```
$ apptainer --version
apptainer version 1.1.3
```

Apptainer needs a chache area for building containers, which defaults to your home directory. It's better to
use a cache area within your project's Lustre area. 
```
export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=/wclustre/simone/apptainer/.apptainer/cache
mkdir -p $APPTAINER_CACHEDIR
```
It's good practice to check what's in your cache and clean the cache regularly. The `--dry-run` option checks, but does not remove files.
```
apptainer cache clean --dry-run
```

### Build / fetch a simple container from Docker Hub

In this section we demonstrate how to fecth a very simple container from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/).
Apptainer understands how to fetch a container from DockerHub and convert it into a local Apptainer container in Singularity Image Format (SIF).
We will create local lolcow.sif image from [lolcow](https://hub.docker.com/r/godlovedc/lolcow) on DockerHub.
```
apptainer build lolcow.sif docker://godlovedc/lolcow
```
Containers frequently contain a script which will be executed when the container is `run`.
```
apptainer run lolcow.sif
```
```

```

Inside the container is a guest Linux environment which is different from the host Linux on the system running the container.
The host Linux is a RH7 derivative, while the environment is this guest is Ubuntu 16.
```
apptainer shell lolcow.sif
```
You will be given a shell running inside the container. Here we use `cat` to examine the Linux version.
```
Apptainer> cat /etc/lsb-release
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=16.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=xenial
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS"

```

### Obtaining a pyTorch container from NVIDIA

NVIDIA provides GPU enabled containers for a wide variety of AI, digital twin, and HPC applications in their
[NGC catalog](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/). Using search we find [pyTorch](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch)
and under [Tags](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch/tags) you will find pYTorch in a variety of versions.
Here we select a recent version with the tag `23.02-py3`. Under the `...` menus select the 'Copy image path' option to get the path to the container.
In the `pull` command below prefix the NGC path with `docker://`. We name the local container `pytorch-23.02-py3.sif`.
```
apptainer pull pytorch-23.02-py3.sif docker://nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:23.02-py3
```
Note that the pull command will take some time to complete and the SIF file will be large (8.4GB)! You many wish to store your SIF files in Lustre.
You may wish to clean your Apptainer cache follwing this pull. 

### Running pyTorch on a GPU worker interactively

Interactive batch jobs are best suited for quick tests or debugging code issues. This section demonstates running a Torch container on a Wilson GPU worker.

We start an interactive slurm job.
```
srun --unbuffered --pty -A wc_test --partition=gpu_gce --gres=gpu:v100:1 --qos=regular --nodes=1 --time=01:00:00 --ntasks-per-node=4 /bin/bash
```

Once we get a shell from slum, we can start a shell in the container
```
apptainer shell --home=/work1/simone --nv pytorch-23.02-py3.sif
```
The `--home` flag tells apptainer to use `/work1/simone` as my home directory. At start, your working directory is the one from which you started apptainer. The `--nv` flag is necessary to tell the guest OS in the container about the host's GPUs.

After the `Appptainer>` shell prompt, we can run python in the container that has Torch installed.
Here, we run the [mnist](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/main/mnist) example.
The `mnist_main.py` example script is located on Wilson in the directory where the batch job was started.
The container provides Python3 with Torch installed.
```
python mnist_main.py
```
You will see output from Torch training in the shell output.

### Running pyTorch as a batch job

Batch jobs are best suited for long runs of established workflows. One or more steps of the workflow are written as bash commands in a file.
The files necessary to run the Torch MNIST example in batch are found in this repository under
[examples/torch_mnist](https://github.com/james-simone/tutorial-Wilson-AI/tree/main/examples/torch_mnist).

Use the `sbatch` command to submit the batch file for execution.
```
sbatch batch_mnist.sh
```
